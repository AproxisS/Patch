# Patch
These are patches for compiling qBittorrent & libtorrent

Best to be used with [userdocs' qbittorrent-nox-static script](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static)

The libtorrent patch is also compatible with [Swizzin](https://github.com/swizzin/swizzin) but would require renaming. Please refer to their [Docs](https://swizzin.ltd/applications/deluge/#libtorrent-patching) for instructions.
